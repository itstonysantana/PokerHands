# PokerHands

The goal of this project was to write a program that randomly generated a hand of cards on each pre-specified iteration, identified the hand, and then obtained statistics on how often a particular hand appeared over the run of the program. The expected values that appear adjacent to the observed hand percentages are what we would expect the the observations to converge to if we ran it repeatedly over an indefinite amount of time.

### Instructions

To run the program:

1. Click 'Run' from the PokerHands class.
2. When prompted, specify the amount of runs you wish the program to perform.
3. When prompted, specify whether or not you would like to see the details of each randomly-generated hand. ('y' for yes, 'n' for no)

Simple analytics on the occurrence rate of each kind of hand will appear, along with their expected occurrence rate.
